Breast Cancer Prediction using Hybrid Machine Learning Model
Oct 2024 - Jan 2025Oct 2024 - Jan 2025

In this project, I developed a hybrid machine learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning (TL) to accurately predict breast cancer. The model leverages CNNs to extract spatial features from medical images, enhanced by transfer learning to utilize pre-trained models for improved accuracy, even with limited data. The dataset used is the well-known Breast Cancer dataset obtained from the UCI repository, which contains various malignancy features.

For this research, I created a custom CNN architecture that was specifically developed and trained over the processed dataset. To enhance the model's robustness, I implemented data augmentation techniques to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization. This hybrid model achieved an impressive accuracy of 92.11% on the test set, demonstrating the significant potential of CNNs combined with transfer learning in breast cancer detection.

This approach not only improves the performance of predictive models but also provides an effective tool for early breast cancer detection, enabling healthcare professionals to make more informed decisions. The results of this project emphasize the power of deep learning in advancing diagnostic tools, offering hope for reduced mortality rates associated with breast cancer.
